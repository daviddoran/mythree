# My3 (Ireland) Usage App

This is a small (mobile friendly) web app for checking your post-pay allowance and usage.
Its only goal is to provide a fast and convenient way to check you're not going over your allowance for the month.

Three Ireland doesn't offer an app or mobile-friendly version of My3. This is an attempt at one.

This app is made up of two parts:

- A client-side JavaScript app for small screens;
- A PHP API that uses cURL to scrape the current usage information from three.ie.
